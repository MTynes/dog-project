This project produces a dog breed detector. It first involves several modules used import the required datasets, create human and dog face detectors, and create a dog breed detector using Python and Keras (with Tensorflow backend).
The final module combines and builds on the previous nodes, resulting in a face detector for dogs and humans that outputs the dog breed that the face most resembles.
